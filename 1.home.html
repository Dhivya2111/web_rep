        Hello! My name is <strong>Dhivya Dharshini.V.C</strong>. I was born in Tamil Nadu and am currently in my second year of a BTech 
        in Computer Science with a specialization in Bioinformatics. I have a keen interest in <strong>Database Management Systems</strong>, 
        learning new coding languages, and data analytics. Although I started as a novice at coding, 
        <em>I never thought of getting into the computer science field in my future</em>, but here I am
        It was hard at the beginning ,I had no idea of what to do but I now know the basics of four languages.
        These are the languages that i know the basics of : 

   <ol align="center" style="margin-top:10px;">
        <li><strong>C</strong></li>
        <li><strong>C++</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Java</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
    </ol>

</p>
    <p align="justify">
        I am also a <em>passionate bookworm</em>, especially fond of genres like <em><font color="#003f88">Mystery, Thriller, Romance, and Fantasy</font></em>. 
        I began reading fiction in 11th grade, and since then, I’ve read over 100 books. Reading has opened up a whole new world for me, 
        fueling my imagination and creativity while also serving as an escape from the harsh realities of life. 
        <strong>It helps me relax and get creative.</strong> As I said previously, it opens up a new world. 
        I am very drawn to fantasy books. It started with <strong>Harry Potter</strong>, imagining all the magic it could do, and then from a scientific angle, 
        <em>what the world would look like in a dystopian era</em>. It's so easy for me to get lost in books.

        These are my favorite books that top the list of my rereads:
    </p>

    <ul type="square">
        <li><strong>Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros</strong></li>
        <li><strong>A Good Girl's Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson</strong></li>
        <li><strong>The Risk by Elle Kennedy</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Love Unwritten by Lauren Asher</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p align="justify">
        As someone who loves exploring new knowledge, I believe my journey in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and my passion for fiction complement each other in unique ways. 
        I aim to blend <em>logical problem-solving</em> with the creativity of storytelling. Whether it's coding or reading, 
        <strong>I strive to make a meaningful impact</strong> and leave my mark on the world.
    </p>

        Books are more than just stories to me , they are windows into different worlds, each with its own unique experience and lessons. I have always found solace in the quiet pages of a book, where time slows down and I can lose myself in new adventures. <strong>The magic of reading lies in its ability to offer both comfort and challenge</strong>, as each book teaches me something new about life, love, and the human spirit. As I dive into the pages, I find myself walking alongside the characters, feeling their joys, sorrows, and triumphs as if they were my own. The beauty of reading is that no two experiences are ever the same. <strong><em>Every book is a new adventure, waiting to be discovered</em></strong>. Whether it’s a fantastical journey through uncharted lands or a deep dive into a character’s emotional journey, books have become an inseparable part of who I am. The endless stories fuel my curiosity and spark my creativity, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next story to unfold.
