        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Dhivya Dharshini.V.C</strong>. I was born in Tamil Nadu and am currently in my second year of a BTech in Computer Science with a specialization in Bioinformatics. I have a keen interest in <strong>Database Management Systems</strong>, learning new coding languages, and data analytics. Although I started as a novice at coding, <em>I never thought of getting into the computer science field in my future</em>, but here I am. It was hard at the beginning, I had no idea of what to do but I now know the basics of four languages. These are the languages that I know the basics of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>C</strong></li>
            <li><strong>C++</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Java</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="books">
        <h2>My Passion for Books</h2>
        <p>I am also a <em>passionate bookworm</em>, especially fond of genres like <em><font color="#003f88">Mystery, Thriller, Romance, and Fantasy</font></em>. I began reading fiction in 11th grade, and since then, Iâ€™ve read over 100 books. Reading has opened up a whole new world for me, fueling my imagination and creativity while also serving as an escape from the harsh realities of life. <strong>It helps me relax and get creative.</strong> As I said previously, it opens up a new world. I am very drawn to fantasy books. It started with <strong>Harry Potter</strong>, imagining all the magic it could do, and then from a scientific angle, <em>what the world would look like in a dystopian era</em>. It's so easy for me to get lost in books.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As someone who loves exploring new knowledge, I believe my journey in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and my passion for fiction complement each other in unique ways. I aim to blend <em>logical problem-solving</em> with the creativity of storytelling. Whether it's coding or reading, <strong>I strive to make a meaningful impact</strong> and leave my mark on the world.</p>
