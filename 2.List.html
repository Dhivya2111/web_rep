             <strong><u>Fourth Wing</u></strong>
            <p>
                Fourth Wing written by Rebecca Yarros is a <em>Romantascy - A Fantasy romance</em> follows <strong>Xaden Riorson</strong>, 
                a rebellion leader, and <strong>Violet Sorrengail</strong>, the daughter of a general, as they navigate a <strong>battle academy 
                where riders bond with dragons.</strong> It's a mix of mystery, romance, fantasy, and emotional connections, highlighting 
                friendships and the evolving romance between the leads. With dragons and signet powers at the 
                core, the novel ends on a cliffhanger. It is the first book in a five-book series.

                powers, and Red-blooded people do not. <strong>Mare Barrow,</strong> <em><strong>a Red, unexpectedly discovers she has a powerful
